# Pricing-Estimate-class-project
The code from my web service I developed to create a pricing estimate for solar panel installation based on the weather at the user's zip code.
It is intended to be used as a web service that can be added to a web application.
It used an api to gather the weather information based on the zip code entered by the user.
It would then return a price based on the weather information recieved.
